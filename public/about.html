<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kurt, and I like to learn new techie stuff. I am currently a Systems Administrator 
   and now hoping to be a Web Developer. I like problem solving and it gets me hyped up when I 
   figure it out and I will try and try till I get it. 
</p>

<p>Besides the techie stuff, I like to play with my guitar and be Jam with friends and most importantly
   being part of the worship team at Church. In my past time, it is either I play Billiards, play music 
   or continue to code. 
</p>

<p>My career goal is to know most of the things a company need on their IT needs. This is includes Technical support,
   Systems Administation, Network administration, Cloud Infrastructure and Web Development.
